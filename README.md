#Phase 1:
      This phase of the project goes over the basic HTML and CSS for the Web applications. This phase of the project doesn't have any functionality. It just shows a rough idea of what the web application would look like. 
      
   This phase has 5 criterions and each of them contains specific functionality that will help us to reach the end goal for our site. 
The first criteria's HTML and CSS are satisfied in this page. When we goto the welcome.html page, our application opens up with user accounts. 
There is a sign in and sign up option that allows users to sign up if they're not already members and sign in option allows them to login to
their pre-existing accounts. 

   The second criteria is satisfied through the Homepage where users are given an option to upload their multimedia content if they choose 
to do so. If they dont they can scroll down and see live multimedia contents that has already been shared by other users. This content also 
shows who's submitting all the multimedia content. 
      
   The third criteria is satisfied throught the homepage where users are allowed to vote or comment the live shared conmments. There's a clickable button that allows users to vote and comment on the content. There's a button next to username that also allows users to follow if they're not already following the user.
    
   The fourth criteria is met rhought the profile html file which allows users to check their own profile as well as others profiles so they can be marked. A user can do differnet things depending on the marking such as add, follow or block users.
   The fifth criteria allows users to send direct messages to another user and the messages can only be seen between those two users specifically. There's no functionality for any of these criterias as of now as they'll be implemented in further phases.
