We have used MaterializedCSS, a front end framework which allows us to incorporate
material design in our social media app. This is the only one framework that we've used in the front end. In our all html files including welcome.html, chatui.html, homepage.html, user_profile.html, we have used libraries from Materializecss. We've selected our theme as deep-purple accent (a materializecss class).
